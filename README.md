# Work Day Scheduler

This is a site that allows you to keep track of your work schedule. The schedule shows times from 8am to 6pm. My work day is from 8:30am to 5:30pm so I extended the times to make it fit my schedule. Upon saving an event it is logged to the local storage and is saved for when you return.

## USER STORY

## ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA

Given a a schedule containing my work hours,
